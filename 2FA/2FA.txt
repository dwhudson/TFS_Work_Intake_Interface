Generally two-factor authentication schemes work by putting the user into an intermediary state using some form of sessions. 

A user who has passed the first factor, say username/password via Basic Auth, has a session opened but not marked as really logged in until they also pass the second factor. Inputting a code or something like that. 

Once both factors are passed their session is marked as fully logged in and they can access their account/data/whatever.

1) Log in 
	hook in - authentication
2) AD authentication
3) Continue

AD where does it hook in?
